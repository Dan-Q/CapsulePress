# Dan Q's Spartanlog

Contains selected posts from my blog, and ocassional content exclusive to my Spartanlog.

## Why Spartan?

I'm not yet convinced by Spartan as a protocol. It's basically... Gemini, minus the encryption, with metadata cut down even further, and adding only one feature: something a bit like being able to "POST" data back to a server. (Yes, I know about Titan.) That's cute, and I might make use of it someday, but for now my Spartan presence is mostly a mirror of my Gemini capsule.

These new-but-simplistic protocols have a certain beauty to them that the modern Web lacks, so I'm glad to be in a position to experiment with so many of them (you'll find me on Gopher, too, as well as - amazingly, on Finger). I hope you enjoy exploring my Spartanlog.
